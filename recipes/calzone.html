    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Calzones are Italian turnovers that are stuffed with an array of ingredients. Pretty much anything that goes on a pizza can go into a calzone.</p>
    <p>The fillings are placed on one half of the circular shaped pizza dough. The dough is then folded over, pinched and sealed, coated with an egg wash or olive oil, and baked in the oven until golden brown.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Meats</li>
        <li>Veggies</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Dip</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
